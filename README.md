# CSC 133 Assignment 3---OPong
 _This project was a small demonstration of the pong game to further hone our understanding of using object oriented design and how they would interact with each other._

## Key Features
- Application of a physics based pong game.
- Demonstration of how an object would move about in a 2-D space using vector math.
- The ball would have a spin speed relative to how hard the ball is hit with the bat.

## How to play
- The player controls the bat using the mouse and they must catch the ball to not let it fall.
- The player will lose all their points if the ball falls off the screen.
- The speed of the ball increases relative to how high the score is.
- The player can see the frame rate, average frame rate, and how long the game has been running by pressing the 'I' key.
